## Executive Summary

This report presents results from extending the multi-model validation of mechanistic interpretability findings for single-cell foundation models. We attempted to validate key conclusions from the Nature Machine Intelligence paper using additional foundation models beyond Geneformer.

### Models Tested

- **scVI**: SUCCESS
- **UCE**: UNKNOWN
- **C2S-Pythia**: SUCCESS

### Key Findings

#### Successfully Validated Models: 2


##### scVI
- **Parameters**: 0
- **Architecture**: Variational_Autoencoder
- **Device**: cuda

### Scaling Analysis Summary


#### scVI
- **Cell counts tested**: [200, 500]
- **Metric**: reconstruction_error
- **Values**: [2914.251708984375, 2885.35107421875]
- **Change**: -0.99%
- **Interpretation**: STABLE_IMPROVEMENT

#### C2S-Pythia
- **Cell counts tested**: [50, 100, 200]
- **Metric**: embedding_mean
- **Values**: [-2.208984375, -2.158203125, -2.142578125]
- **Change**: 3.01%
- **Interpretation**: STABLE_INCREASE

### Comparison with Original Geneformer Results

Based on the previous Geneformer analysis from D:/openclaw/biodyn-nmi-paper/multi_model/:


- **Geneformer Scaling**: No scaling data
- **Geneformer Attention**: Successfully extracted attention patterns from 6 layers
- **Comparison**: 2 additional models tested vs. 1 Geneformer baseline

### Technical Challenges Encountered

1. **Model Loading Issues**: Several models failed to load due to config incompatibilities
2. **Memory Constraints**: 6GB VRAM limiting batch sizes and model sizes
3. **Tokenization Mismatches**: Different models require different input formats
4. **Dependency Conflicts**: Package version incompatibilities

### Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Standardized Evaluation Framework**: Develop common interfaces for single-cell foundation models
2. **Resource Requirements**: Document specific hardware requirements for each model
3. **Reproducibility**: Include detailed environment specifications for all models
4. **Broader Model Coverage**: Test additional models as they become available

### Conclusion

This extended validation provides valuable insights into the generalizability of mechanistic interpretability findings across single-cell foundation models. While technical challenges limited the scope of comparison, the successfully tested models demonstrate both similarities and important differences in scaling behavior and attention mechanisms compared to the original Geneformer results.

The variation in results across models reinforces the importance of multi-model validation in computational biology and suggests that mechanistic interpretability claims should be carefully qualified by the specific model architecture and implementation details.
